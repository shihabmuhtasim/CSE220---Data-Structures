This repository contains code related to the CSE220 - Data Structures course, which covers various data structures and their implementations in programming languages. 

## What are Data Structures?

Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. They provide a way to manage large amounts of data, such as lists, tables, and graphs, and perform various operations on them.

## Course Contents

The CSE220 - Data Structures course covers the following topics:

- Stack
- Array
- Circular Array
- Different types of Linked Lists
- Recursion
- Hash Table

## Contents of this Repository

This repository contains the following:

- Assignments of the course
- Practice problem solutions
- My own implementation of the Stack data structure's Infix to Postfix conversion code in python

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you will need to have a compiler for the programming language of your choice installed on your machine. You can use any text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to edit and run the code.
